    <p>Modern <span class="caps">ASIC</span> design differs to conventional software engineering in two
fundamental aspects that require a somewhat different approach to project&nbsp;development:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Transformations and representations</strong>. The creation of an <span class="caps">ASIC</span> design from
  a source-level representation through to a final <span class="caps">GDSII</span> description of the
  layout involves many stages of incremental transformations of the circuit and
  layout, and then incremental assembly of components into various subsystems
  before finally the entire chip. At various stages through this process, checks
  are performed on the design typically using simplified representations to
  reduce complexity and make run times&nbsp;practical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tooling</strong>. Compared to software tooling, standard <span class="caps">ASIC</span> design tooling
  (known in the industry as <em>electronic design automation</em>) :
    (1) is almost all proprietary and used under license, meaning that interactive
    and automated use is limited and at odds with a continuous-integration model
    of development; and
    (2) can have long run times (upwards of 12 hours for a job are not uncommon) and produce
    vast quantities of data, making it very unattractive to rerun something
    unless absolutely necessary; and
    (3) can be non-deterministic in that rerunning a job with the same set of inputs
    produces a different&nbsp;output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tape out</strong>. When a design is released for manufacture (known in the
  industry as a <em>tape out</em>), there are typically high non-recoverable expenses associated
  with setting up the processes and a long lead time in receiving a (hopefully)
  working device. There are two implications of this situation:
    (1) chip tape outs precludes incremental releases, for example to fix trivial bugs, and
    therefore means that the confidence in the correct functionality of the
    design must be very high;
    (2) post tape out, the design source code is effectively frozen forever more for
    the purposes of debug and&nbsp;analysis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these differences, many of the techniques and tools from software
engineering can readily be applied to <span class="caps">ASIC</span> development, particularly to manage
complexity and maintain high standards of code quality, testing and
integration. This note lays out some thoughts and opinions on the components
and structure of a software infrastructure to build <span class="caps">ASIC</span>&nbsp;chips.</p>

</ol>
<h2>Aims <a name="aims" class="anchor"></a></h2>
<p>The overall objective of a silicon infrastructure is to <strong>support the
development of a verified <span class="caps">ASIC</span> design from <span class="caps">RTL</span> to <span class="caps">GDSII</span></strong>. To make this more
specific, I also define the following capabilities that should be supported as
an overall philosophy of the approach that is explored in this&nbsp;note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To <strong>rerun everything from scratch</strong>, requiring full
  automation of an the end-to-end flow. This is intended to: (1) distribute the
  task of integrating components of a design across a team, thereby revealing
  issues at as earlier stage in the project as possible to avoid disruptive
  changes towards the end; (2) enable faster design iterational; and (3)
  provide tracability of results, providing a foundation for the next&nbsp;aim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a <strong>full audit trail</strong> such that a release of a design for tape out
  has data and a set of reports, logs, coverage metrics, documentation and
  signoffs that are tracable back to the original <span class="caps">RTL</span> source files. This is
  important for building confidence to tape out, as well as providing information
  for future work on a taped-out&nbsp;design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support <strong>multiple chips and frozen designs</strong> to keep previous generations
  alive for debug of silicon issues and/or as a basis for a incremental tape out
  (known as a <em>respin</em>), and to allow multiple designs to be built&nbsp;concurrently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Guiding principles <a name="principles" class="anchor"></a></h2>
<p>I think it is useful to underpin the aims, implementation and operation of an
<span class="caps">ASIC</span> design infrastructure are a set of guiding principles for the project team
to employ when design decisions need to be made.  These principles are formed
from my own experience and through conversations with others. I am sure that
alternative foundations can be constructed and argued&nbsp;for.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Simple and explicit</strong>. Build a complex system using simple, well-defined
components composed and controlled using explicit mechanisms. Conversely, avoid
easy-to-use high-level interfaces that hide important behaviours. This borrows
from the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a>: <em>explicit is better
than implicit and simple is better than complex</em>. Examples include avoiding the
use of global variables, preferring flat rather than nested, preferring
decisions to be made explicitly and avoiding special cases that break the&nbsp;rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a monorepository</strong>. One repository should contain all the code for all
active projects. This enhances all team members&#8217; ability to integrate their
changes across projects and removes barriers to interaction between different
teams and/or areas of the design. Other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo">general
benefits</a> of a monorepository are the
ability to reuse code and do large-scale refactoring. A great deal of care must
be taken to manage dependencies between projects/components within a
monorepository. Without such care, unexpected interdependencies can cause
unexpected breakages, prevent refactoring and preclude focused testing. In
general: isolate components by restricting them to only be able to access their
listed dependencies; divide components by function and abstraction level (eg
don&#8217;t group by language or technology); and use a standard structure for each
component (such as <code>lib</code>, <code>sources</code>, <code>README</code> etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace open source</strong>. To save on effort, leverage freely-available tools
and libraries wherever possible in the infrastructure, rather than implementing
custom versions. Where open source is used, contributions back upstream benefit
the community and help to align the project with the way it is being deployed.
This particularly applies to open source in the <span class="caps">ASIC</span>/<span class="caps">FPGA</span> domain, where
<a href="https://github.com/aolofsson/awesome-opensource-hardware">open-source software</a> is unencumbered by licensing restrictions.  Often
chip projects will be on tight schedules, so careful judgement of the
effort-benefit tradeoff must be&nbsp;made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance is important</strong>. With the ability to rerun everything from
scratch coupled with a multi-chip and monorepository approach, the compute
demands can scale quickly so it is crucial that the infrastructure is
performant. This can easily become a problem with codebases make extensive use
of a scripting language such as Python.  Mitigations include writing (or
rewriting) parts in a lower-level language such as C++, and setting things up in
such a way that this Python and C++ components can interoperate cleanly (eg
well-defined boundaries and&nbsp;dependencies).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Flows <a name="flows" class="anchor"></a></h2>
<p>This section outlines the high-level <em>flows</em> that an <span class="caps">ASIC</span> infrastructure needs
to support, meaning (typically) a sequence of steps to achieve some <em>task</em>.
This is not meant to be exhaustive, but characteristic of the types of tasks
that need to be performed. Flows can be just a single step or can be composed
together to create different flows, but always have defined inputs and outputs.
I use the term <em>job</em> to mean a particular program or script that is executed,
typically corresponding to a&nbsp;step.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design representation</strong>. To read a design into a tool, it must have a
  complete representation including tool-agnostic configuration, macro defines,
  library files and <span class="caps">RTL</span> sources. Often, <span class="caps">RTL</span> code will need to be generated
  programatically using templates or other types of code generators. It is also
  typical that a design will be implemented in a hierarchical fashion, so a
  configuration step must gather together the required modules and package it
  into a single representation. As an example, the open-source <a href="https://github.com/pulp-platform/bender">Bender</a>
  dependency management tool provides very similar&nbsp;functionality.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Verification representation</strong>. For the purposes of simulation and
  analysis, a verification representation is a variation of a design
  representation, adding configuration and macro defines, source files for a test
  bench, monitors, assertions etc, and possibly substituting parts of the design
  for fast models or block boxes. These verification components will likely live
  with the corresponding parts of the design and be collected together as they
  were for the design representation during a configure&nbsp;step.</li>
</ul>
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/https://jwh.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/homepage/silicon-infra/verif-representation.png" alt="No alt text">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lint checking</strong>. <span class="caps">RTL</span> source code can be checked for basic coding issues
  (referred to as <em>linting</em>) by passing it through tools that perform various
  built-in or custom checks. The input to this task is the specification of a
  design and the output is a list of warnings to be reviewed. Example open-source
  tools that can be used for linting are <a href="https://verilator.org/guide/latest">Verilator</a>,
  <a href="https://chipsalliance.github.io/verible">Verible</a>, <a href="https://sv-lang.com">Slang</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dalance/svlint">svlint</a> and <a href="https://yosyshq.net/yosys">Yosys</a>.</li>
</ul>

    <img class="figure-img img-fluid thumbnail" src="/thumbs/lint-check_1000x1000.png" alt="No alt text">
  </a>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong><span class="caps">CDC</span> and <span class="caps">RDC</span> checking</strong>. Clock- and reset-domain crossings can be checked
  automatically with tools that analyse a design, typically with a set of
  annotations and constraints. The output will be warning messages from the
  checker that need to be&nbsp;investigated.</li>
</ul>
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/https://jwh.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/homepage/silicon-infra/cdc-rdc-check.png" alt="No alt text">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Simulation testbench</strong>. A simulation test bench requires a representaiton
  of the design, a verification environment and test stimulus. Test stimulus
  is often randomly generated. Coverage (structural or functional) can be
  collected during simulation, and when many test instances are run for a
  particular test generator or over a larger regression of different test
  generators, coverage may need to be merged then reported on. Simulation is
  typically performed on an <span class="caps">RTL</span> representation, but is also done on gate-level
  netlists and with delay&nbsp;annotations.</li>
</ul>
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/https://jwh.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/homepage/silicon-infra/simulation-flow.png" alt="No alt text">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Formal property test bench</strong>. Analysing and proving formal properties of a
  design is a complementary technique to standard functional coverage. Inputs
  to this are a verification representation of the design and a set of
  assumptions and properties to be&nbsp;checked.</li>
</ul>
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/https://jwh.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/homepage/silicon-infra/formal-property-check.png" alt="No alt text">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Formal equivalence check</strong>. As a design is incrementally transformed
  between <span class="caps">RTL</span> and <span class="caps">GDSII</span>, it is essential to perform equivalence checks to
  prove that each transformation maintains the functional behaviour of the
  design. Inputs to an equivalence check are two representations, typically
  called a <em>reference</em> that is the baseline and an <em>implementation</em> to&nbsp;check.</li>
</ul>
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/https://jwh.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/homepage/silicon-infra/equivalence-flow.png" alt="No alt text">
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Physical build</strong>. All flows up to this point have mainly operated on <span class="caps">RTL</span>
  representations of a design. A physical build flow starts off by
  transforming <span class="caps">RTL</span> into gates using a synthesis tool, then progressively
  transforms the design into a set of two-dimensional layers. Following synthesis
  are: scan insertion for <span class="caps">DFT</span>, floorplanning (placing ports and macros),
  placement (placing cells), clock tree synthesis, routing (establishing all
  required connections using the available routing layers, finishing and
  checking. See <a href="https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD">OpenROAD</a> for an example open source physical build&nbsp;flow.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A note on <span class="caps">DFT</span></strong>. A central aspect of any <span class="caps">ASIC</span> design is the <span class="caps">DFT</span> (device
test) strategy. Testability is achieved by adding logic in the form of
<em>instruments</em> and <em>connectivity</em> to make the the existing logic
<em>controllable</em> and <em>observable</em>. The means by which this is done and the
point in the <span class="caps">ASIC</span> process is heavily dependent on the design and the tooling
used. Typically, <span class="caps">DFT</span> logic is inserted using automated tools during the
physical build but increasingly it is being added in <span class="caps">RTL</span> also using automated
tooling - either way adding additional transformation steps to the front- or
back-end&nbsp;flows.</p>
<p><strong>A note on physical builds</strong>. There are two unique aspects of physical
builds that present challenges for the infrastructure presented in this note.
The first is that physical <span class="caps">EDA</span> tools do not always produce the same output
given the same inputs due to the nature of the optimisation algorithms they
use. The second is that close to the closure of a design component, manual
interventions will be made to address localised issues in the design. The
combinaion of these issues mean that it is not possible to rerun physical
builds from scratch and achive satisfactory results. Therefore, a silicon
infrastructure must be able to support frozen data from particular flow&nbsp;stages.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Model <a name="model" class="anchor"></a></h2>
<p>A conceptual model for the use cases described is a hierarchical collection of
<em>tasks</em> that consume inputs and produce outputs. A task can be dependendent on
another task by consuming its output and tasks can be composed together into
<em>flows</em>. The set of tasks implementing a flow form a directed graph that is
determined statically (ie without any dependence on runtime&nbsp;data).</p>
<p>A <em>task</em> is defined&nbsp;by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A set of&nbsp;inputs.</li>
<li>A set of&nbsp;outputs.</li>
<li>A set of configuration&nbsp;options.</li>
<li>A set of resource requirements (time, memory,&nbsp;cores).</li>
<li>An <em>action</em> that that operates only on the inputs and must produce all the
  outputs, typically achived by executing a script or separate&nbsp;tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <em>flow</em> is defined&nbsp;by:</p>
<ul>
<li>A set of&nbsp;inputs.</li>
<li>A set of&nbsp;outputs.</li>
<li>A set of configuration&nbsp;options.</li>
<li>A set of resource&nbsp;requirements.</li>
<li>A <em>action</em> consisting of executing one or more tasks. Tasks can be specified
  using <em>replication</em> with static bounds to create arrays, and <em>conditionality</em>
  to exclude or include tasks dependent on the configuration&nbsp;values.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Components <a name="components" class="anchor"></a></h2>
<p>This section sketches out a silicon infrastructure by focussing on the main
components and their requirements and/or&nbsp;features.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Job runner</strong>. The lowest layer of the infrastructure is responsible for
  providing an execution engine for jobs. This&nbsp;provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A controlled environment execution environment with specific tool versions for reproducability and legacy support, likely in a container such as <a href="https://apptainer.org">Singularity/Apptainer</a>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dispatching of jobs to compute resources, such as a compute cluster, which requires interaction with a queueing system such as <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com">Slurm</a>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shepherding of data inputs and outputs of a&nbsp;job;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring of job status, including propagation of statuses and errors, and logging of messages from jobs being&nbsp;run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buildsystem</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
