# About me

I'm Jamie and I work as an engineer at [GraphCore](http://www.graphcore.ai)
Bristol (UK), on the development of a chip to accelerate machine learning
applications.

I'm also a director of the [CHEESE project](http://cheeseproject.co.uk), a
not-for-profit enterprise that uses thermal imaging to help people reduce
domestic energy losses, thereby saving money and reducing our carbon emissions.

I have previously worked at [XMOS](http://www.xmos.com>) and [Red Oak
Consulting](http://www.redoakconsulting.co.uk).

I completed a PhD at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk) in
the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk) in 2014, with
a thesis entitled
[Scalable abstractions for general-purpose parallel computation]({filename}/thesis.md).
