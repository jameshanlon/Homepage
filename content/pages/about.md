# About me

I currently work as an engineer in the silicon team at
[Graphcore](http://www.graphcore.ai), based in Bristol in the UK, on the
development of a new processor for machine intelligence.

In my spare time, I help to run the [CHEESE
project](http://cheeseproject.co.uk), a not-for-profit enterprise that uses
thermal imaging to help people reduce domestic energy losses. For those who
struggle to heat their homes, it improves their health and well being, and for
those who have thermally-inefficient homes, it saves them money and reduces
their carbon emissions. I'm a member of the management committee, and work as a
surveyor during the winter seasons.

I have previously worked as a software engineer specialising on the compiler
toolchain at [XMOS](http://www.xmos.com) in Bristol, who develop embedded
parallel processors with deterministic behaviour, and as a technical consultant
at [Red Oak Consulting](http://www.redoakconsulting.co.uk) in Cheltenham, who
specialise in high-performance computing.

I completed a PhD at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk) in the
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk) in 2014, with a
thesis entitled *[Scalable abstractions for general-purpose parallel
computation]({filename}/thesis.md)*, which investigated the relationship
between the hardware implementation of highly-parallel computers and
programming languages and software for them. I hold a masters degree in
Computer Science from the same institution.

## About this website

My intention with this website is somewhere to [archive](/archive.html) my old
academic work, and as a way to publish [notes](/notes.html) on topics that
interest me and details of [projects](/projects.html) that I've undertaken in
my spare time. These are a record for myself and available on the off-chance
they will be useful to someone who might come across this website. I'd love to
hear from you if that's the case.

I built this website using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com), a static
website generator software written in Python. The theme is simply derived from
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and it runs on a server using
[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com). The source code is available for reuse on
[Github](https://github.com/jameshanlon/homepage).
