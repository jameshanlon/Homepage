# About me

Since 2016, I have worked at the UK-based chip company
[Graphcore](http://www.graphcore.ai), where I lead the Silicon Logical Design
team. My work is focussed on the design and implementation of high-performance
chips for accelerating machine-intelligence workloads.

I have been a director of [The CHEESE Project](http://www.cheeseproject.co.uk)
since 2015, a not-for-profit enterprise that uses thermal imaging to encourage
people to reduce their domestic energy losses. For those who struggle to heat
their homes, it improves their health and well being, and for those who have
thermally-inefficient homes, it saves them money and reduces their carbon
emissions. As part of the expansion of CHEESE nationwide, I have helped to
found [First Thermal](http://www.first-thermal.co.uk), a social franchise to
replicate the approach.

I have previously worked as a software engineer specialising in the compiler
toolchain at [XMOS](http://www.xmos.com) in Bristol for their embedded
parallel processors, and as a technical consultant at [Red Oak
Consulting](http://www.redoakconsulting.co.uk) in Cheltenham, who specialise in
services for high-performance computing.

I completed a PhD at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk) in the
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk) in 2014, with a
thesis entitled *[Scalable abstractions for general-purpose parallel
computation]({filename}/thesis.md)*, which investigated the relationship
between the hardware implementation of highly-parallel computers and
programming languages and software for them. I hold a masters degree in
Computer Science from the same institution.

# About this website

My intention with this website is to provide somewhere for me to
[archive](/archive.html) my old academic work, and a way to publish notes on
topics that interest me and details of projects that I've undertaken in my
spare time. These notes are written primarily as a record for myself, but they
are publically available in the hope they will be useful to others. I'd
love to hear from you if that's the case.

This website is built using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com), a static
website generator written in Python. The theme is simply derived from
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and it is hosted on GitHub Pages. The
source code is available for
[reuse](https://github.com/jameshanlon/jameshanlon.github.io).
