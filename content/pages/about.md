# About me

I work as an engineer in the Silicon team at
[Graphcore](http://www.graphcore.ai), based in Bristol in the UK, on the
development of processors for machine intelligence. My current work is focussed
on physical and logical implementation of aspects.

In my spare time, I help to run the [CHEESE project](http://cheeseproject.co.uk),
a not-for-profit enterprise that uses thermal imaging to encourage people to reduce
their domestic energy losses. For those who struggle to heat their homes, it improves
their health and well being, and for those who have thermally-inefficient
homes, it saves them money and reduces their carbon emissions. I'm a member of
the management committee.

I have previously worked as a software engineer specialising on the compiler
toolchain at [XMOS](http://www.xmos.com) in Bristol, for their embedded
parallel processors, and as a technical consultant at [Red Oak
Consulting](http://www.redoakconsulting.co.uk) in Cheltenham, who specialise in
high-performance computing.

I completed a PhD at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk) in the
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk) in 2014, with a
thesis entitled *[Scalable abstractions for general-purpose parallel
computation]({filename}/thesis.md)*, which investigated the relationship
between the hardware implementation of highly-parallel computers and
programming languages and software for them. I hold a masters degree in
Computer Science from the same institution.

# About this website

My intention with this website is to provide somewhere for me to
[archive](/archive.html) my old academic work, and a way to publish notes on
topics that interest me and details of projects that I've undertaken in my
spare time. These notes are written primarily as a record for myself, but they
are publically available in the hope they will be useful to others. I'd
love to hear from you if that's the case.

This website is built using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com), a static
website generator written in Python. The theme is simply derived from
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and it is hosted on GitHub Pages. The
source code is available for
[reuse](https://github.com/jameshanlon/jameshanlon.github.io).
