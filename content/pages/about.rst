:Title: About

I work as an engineer at `GraphCore <http://www.graphcore.ai>`_ in Bristol, on
the development of a chip to accelerate machine learning applications.

I'm also a director of the `CHEESE project <http://cheeseproject.co.uk>`_, a
not-for-profit enterprise that uses thermal imaging to help people reduce
domestic energy losses, thereby saving money and reducing our carbon emissions.

I have previously worked at `XMOS <http://www.xmos.com>`_ and `Red Oak
Consulting <http://www.redoakconsulting.co.uk>`_.

I completed a PhD at the `University of Bristol <http://www.bris.ac.uk>`_ in
the `Department of Computer Science <http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk>`_ in 2014, with
a thesis titled `Scalable abstractions for general-purpose parallel computation
<{filename}/pages/thesis.rst>`_.
