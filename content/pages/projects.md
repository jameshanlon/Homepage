## Netlist Paths

Netlist paths is a library and command-line tool for querying a Verilog
netlist. It reads an XML representation of a design's netlist, produced by
[Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator), and provides
facilities for inspecting types, variables and paths. The library is written in
C++ and has a Python interface.
