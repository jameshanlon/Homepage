## Netlist Paths

Netlist Paths is a library and command-line tool for querying a Verilog
netlist. It reads an XML representation of a design's netlist, produced by
[Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/projects/verilator), and provides
facilities for inspecting types, variables and paths. The library is written in
C++ and has a Python interface.

## Hex processor

The Hex Architecture is a very simple processor designed by David May and
intended for explaining how a computer works. This repository contains an
implementation in Verilog and basic tooling written in C++ for developing
programs (a compiler, assembler and simulator). It was written out of curiosity
and to serve as an example of how high-level programs relate to the underlying
hardware implementation.
