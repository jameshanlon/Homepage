I live in a [Cornish Unit house (Type
1)](https://nonstandardhouse.com/cornish-unit-type-1-precast-reinforced-concrete-house/)
and have recently had a heat pump installed to replace an aging gas boiler.
Having lived in the house for two winters, I was well aware of significant
thermal issues due to the house being so cold. A non-invasive [survey of the
building](home-thermal-imaging-survey.html) last winter showed up various minor
issues but didn't pinpoint a particular issue. Further investigation into the
upstairs walls revealed there to be virtually no insulation, only ~50mm of
glass wool insulation hanging behind the plasterboard, as well as direct routes
into the floor cavity (along the joists) from the eaves. The effective result
is a plasterboard tent upstairs with cold air circulating just behind the
walls, and to an extent the floor/ceiling.

The upper part of the house is a timber construction, so the walls have voids
between the timbers that new insulation can be fitted into. This seemed like an
easy win given that buildings with masonary walls can only have insulation
added externally or internally. Insulation is often added to Cornish Unit
houses when they are retiled since all of the timbers are exposed. However, in
my case given the roof is fine, installing the insulation internally is simpler
and much cheaper, albiet a more messy job. The detail below shows the planned
modification: adding 80 mm of PIR insulation board between the joists, and 25
mm insulated plasterboard on top with a sandwiched breathable vapour membrane,
providing 105 mm of insulation and an expected U-value of 0.25 W/m$^2$K. The
full description as submitted to building control is as follows:

Upgrading external wall insulation within timber framed wall at first floor
level, which forms lower section of tiled mansard roof on a Cornish Unit Type 1
house. Hanging tiles with breather membrane to remain as existing. Replacing
existing 80mm mineral wool insulation with 80mm rigid PIR insulation board
between studs within the timber frame. Adding a vapour control layer and dry
lining the internal face with 37.5mm insulated plasterboard, plaster and
finish.

**Proposed wall build up**:

  - Roof tiles hanging (to remain as existing).
  - Breather membrane (to remain as existing).
  - Ventilated cavity (30mm at high level - 335mm at low level).
  - 80mm PIR insulation board between studs (Celotex GA4000 80mm).
  - Combined vapour control & air tightness layer, taped (Procheck Adapt VCL with integral tape).
  - 37.5mm insulated plasterboard (Celotex PL4025 25 + 12.5mm).
  - Internal finish (plaster and paint).

**Method of installation**: Renovation to be completed from inside the property by
removing plasterboard and existing mineral wool insulation internally to expose
the frame. Mineral wool insulation to be replaced by 80mm PIR insulation boards
between timber studs. Breather membrane and roof tiles to remain as existing.
Timber battens to be installed at high level to form a 30mm ventilated cavity.
Continuous vapour control and airtightness layer to be added on the internal face
of the PIR insulation board and taped. 37.5mm layer of insulated plasterboard
to be installed onto the VCL. Plaster and paint to finish.

**Notes**: Insulation at lower eaves to be made continuous with existing cavity
wall bead insulation to ground floor masonry wall. Similarly, insulation to be
made continuous at ceiling junction with existing mineral wool insulation
between ceiling joists in roof void, where possible. Estimated U-value of
proposed build-up = 0.25 W/m$^2$K (source: Saint Gobain UK U-value calculator).
