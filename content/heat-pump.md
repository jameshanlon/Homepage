Summary: A review of one year's worth of data from my home heat pump.
Status: published

{% import 'post-macros.html' as macros %}

I had a heat pump installed in my house in July 2022, and a year later a
[Vaillant gateway][gateway], which provides monitoring and logging services
via a 'myVaillant' smartphone app. Since I now
have a year's worth of data, this note reviews what has been logged to see
how the system is performing.

The heatpump is a 10 kW Vaillant Arotherm plus (pictured above), serving my
house of approximately 90 square meters internal area. I have previously posted
about the building's [energy efficiency](home-thermal-imaging-survey.html) and
[additional insulation](cornish-unit-house-retrofit-insulation.html) added.
This pump's capacity the current requirements of the house, but we are planning
an extension in the near future. In terms of the operation of the heat pump, heating
is set to run consinuously with a fixed temperature of 19 celcius is set in the
downstairs hallway, and hot water is fixed and continuous at 50 celcius.

The myVaillant app usefully provides a button to download all logged data per
year in a set of CSV files. I have summarised the year period from July 2023 to
July 2024 in the following charts. Having read this [review][pfb-vaillant-app]
of the myVaillant app, I am aware that there may be accuracy/quantization
issues but without any other means of measuring the metrics, I don't have a
point of comparison. It is likely though in the last year or so that Vaillant
have improved the reported measurements.

The first chart shows the consumption of electrical energy for heating (red)
and hot water (blue). Most obviously, electricity consumption during the winter
months rockets when the heat pump is using around 10 kWh per day. There are two
spikes in November and Janurary where temperatures went below zero, with
consumption going up close to 30 kWh per day. As expected, hot water is more
consistent thoughout the year with an increase through the winter months. The
total electrical energy for heating for the year is 1.35 MWh and 1.04 MWh for
hot water.

The short periods where both drop to zero are due either to a holiday or
a technical issue. The only time the heat pump has stopped working has been
when there has been a loss of pressure in the system, requiring a manual topup
from the mains.

The next chart is the heat energy generated and the one after is the ratio
between generated and consumed, or the coefficient of performance (COP).

                       caption="Heat energy generated (hot water and heating) in kWh.") }}

The average COP in this period is 3.3. The Vaillant app reports 3.4, which may
be taking into account the quiescent periods.
