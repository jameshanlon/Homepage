Summary: A review of one year's worth of data from my home heat pump.
Status: published

{% import 'post-macros.html' as macros %}

I had a heat pump installed in my house in July 2022, and a year later a
[Vaillant gateway][gateway], which provides monitoring and logging services
via a 'myVaillant' smartphone app. Since I now
have a year's worth of data, this note reviews what has been logged to see
how the system is performing.

The heatpump is a 10 kW Vaillant Arotherm plus (pictured above), serving a
house of approximately 90 square meters. I have previously posted about the building's
[energy efficiency](home-thermal-imaging-survey.html) and
[additional insulation](cornish-unit-house-retrofit-insulation.html) added. This
pump's capacity the current requirements of the house, but we are planning an
extension in the near future. In terms of the operation of the heat pump, it is set to
run consinuously with a fixed temperature of 19 celcius is set in the downstairs hallway.

The myVaillant app usefully provides a button to download all logged data per year
in a set of CSV files. I have summarised the year period from July 2023 to July 2024
in the following charts. Having read this [review][pfb-vailiant-app]) of the myVaillant
app, I am aware that there may be accuracy/quantization issues but without any other
means of measuring the metrics, I don't have a point of comparison. It is likely though
in the last year or so that Vaillant have improved the reported measurements, but I will
outline some other potential inaccuracies.

The first chart shows the consumption of electrical energy for heating and hot water. Most
obviously, electricity consumption during the winter months rockets when the heat pump is 
using around 10 kWh per day. There are two spikes in November and Januaray where temperatures
went below zero, with consumption going up close to 30 kWh per day.

The following chart shows the coefficient of performance (COP), calculated by
dividing the heat generated from hot water and heating by the total electrical
energy consumed, both in kWh.
